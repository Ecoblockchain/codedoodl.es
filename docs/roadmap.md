# Roadmap

This is very much a first iteration, we wanted to get something basic released as soon as possible, and are hoping that there will be sufficient interest / engagement from the creative coding community to warrant the future development of more intricate features and functionality, some ideas include:

* <code>**Filtering / sorting**</code>

	Hopefully we'll have enough doodles submitted and added to the site to warrant a more sophisticated filtering / searching mechanism, such as filtering by tag, author, interaction type etc.

* <code>**Voting system**</code>

	Again, will only really become useful with more content, but a basic doodle ranking will help mechanism will help keep the best stuff the most visible.

* <code>**Additional options per doodle**</code>

	Possibly have the option of passing a parameter / query to the doodle, meaning that we can have some centralised way to interact. For example, having a checkbox within the doodle info section to enable GUI for that particular doodle, or perhaps to enable sound.

* <code>**Additional browser extensions**</code>

	Currently only chrome, wouldn't take much to port to other platforms.

* <code>**Browser-extension specific context**</code>

	Browser extensions provide deeper integration with the user's host machine, and access to things that a standard website does not. It may be interesting to investigate allowing doodles to have access to certain things when being run within the extension context.

* <code>**User-defined settings within browser extensions**</code>

	Options to personlise the experience, for example by selecting only tags that you are interested in, and then only being served doodles meeting this criteria.
