# Contributing to the site

Clone the repo, submit a pull request!

Hint - to get the site up and running locally:

1. `$ git clone git@github.com:neilcarpenter/codedoodl.es.git`
2. `$ cd codedoodl.es`
3. `$ [sudo] npm i`
4. `$ npm run start`
5. Open http://127.0.0.1:3000

All assets are currently bundled in repo, so you don't need to compile anything, but if you do want to build + watch then:

1. `$ gulp`

Check files in `/gulp` for breakdown of gulp tasks.
