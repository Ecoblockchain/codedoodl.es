### Doodle criteria

The purpose of codedoodl.es is a little different to the other code-showcasing sites out there - we want to [... something about them being doodle-y]. In order to maintain consistency with regards to viewer expectation, and [... something about load times], we have laid out some basic entry criteria for each doodle.

Note that the criteria here are more guidelines for the most part - every doodle submitted will be reviewed by a human, and so there will always be flexibility here - we're just trying to create some consistency.

##### Minimum requirements

These are the minimum number of files required for each doodle, these will be used to display / reference each individual doodle on the site / extension.

* <code>index.html</code>

	Every doodle must have a single `index.html` file as an entry point. This file must be situated in the root of the doodle directory, which will located in `/doodles/<author_github_username>/<doodle_name>` as outlined above.

* <code>thumbnail JPEG 300x300 px</code>

	A single 300px by 300px JPEG thumbnail for the doodle must be in the root of the doodle directory.

* <code>manifest.json</code>

	Most importantly - each doodle requires a manifest file which contains all the metadata for the doodle, including doodle information / instructions, author details and tech used. You can manually create this file based on the schema outlined [here](here), or if you use the doodle-creation utility script, the manifest will be automatically generated based on answers you have given.

### Roadmap

This is very much a first iteration, we wanted to get something basic released as soon as possible, and are hoping that there will be sufficient interest / engagement from the creative coding community to warrant the future development of more intricate features and functionality, some ideas include:

* <code>Voting system</code>

	Assuming (hoping) that we have enough doodles submitted [... rank]

* <code>Filtering</code>

	Blah

* <code>Additional options per doodle</code>

	Blah
